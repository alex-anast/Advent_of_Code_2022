The first problem had to do with working with an input data file.
It was really easy.

It is my first time taking part in such a competition, so as I was unaware of the starting difficulty,
I started working with Python. It was interesting to see the same problem and solution with bash language,
since I use daily. The problem was a nice trigger to see comparators and variables in bash.

Lastly, it would be nice to implement in C++ which is much more memory specific.
Next #TODO for C++ is to implement either strings and vectors or a more C-style solution.
